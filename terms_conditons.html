                    <li class="text-justify">The definition of the term “Quote” means any policy or quotation suited to your specific requirements that takes in consideration your individual lifestyle for instance. With the service that we provide we do not act as a broker, agent or third party for any particular insurer at any one time, although we work as a price searcher only. We may provide you with the links to comparison websites, and other various companies, to find you the best possible deals so that you can use our services to obtain multiple quotes from different providers of your own choice and buy online / offline. In any case if would like us to manually fill out any form on your behalf according to your individual specification and circumstances, we can work on finding you quote, as long as you authorise us and provide us with accurate information. Based on the details given, we can provide you the free non-obligatory quotes from various companies. With the given information we will manually search into a variety of prospects to find insurance suited to your means. Usually this is a more challenging premium which in turn will save you money and time. We cannot make any alterations to the insurance policy itself but we can endeavour to find the type of policy that fits your requirements. Your quotes include our administration (Service) fee, interest and all other charges, but it does not include any charges from insurer or broker that may arise later on if you instruct any amendment or alteration to the policy after setting up. Such amendments might be a change of car or change of address for example. When we provide you with quotes we always process your data and payment information according to the Data Protection Act 1998.</li>
                    <li class="text-justify">Your responsibility to provide accurate details and if your insurer provides any unfair terms the following terms and conditions are applicable for all customers (specially who receive Quotes service): The payment you make to insurance company is for insurance cover only. You must only give consent to pay the insurer/broker, if you agree with insurer’s/broker’s terms and conditions as stated on their website. You pay us a separate service fee for Price Searching Work. If the insurer accepts the payment from your bank card, this fee is non-refundable. We do not take any commission from the insurer and our services are limited to price searching work only. If the payment does not go through due to incorrect or false information provided to us by you, such as but not limited to undeclared accidents, penalties & NCB, we reserve the right to charge an admin fee from the amount that you would pay to us, even if we do not manage to find you a quote with the correct information given to us afterwards. If any similar quotation that is generated through our work is bought, the charges for our work may apply depending on circumstances. If the insurer imposes any unfair terms to cancel your policy, depending on the time of cover we may deduct only £50 of the service charge you have paid us and refund you the rest although according to our full terms we are not obliged to do this.</li>

                    Any driver who has had any accidents (fault or non-fault) or claims (whether claim made or not) in the last 5 years must disclose this information when asked, failing to do so may lead to an increase of the premium or it may invalidate insurance with the possibility of cancellation fees. Insurers or brokers may also check with CUE for the history of any accidents or claims recorded within the CUE database. The Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) is a central database of motor, home and personal injury/industrial illness incidents reported to insurance companies, which may or may not give rise to a claim.

                    Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), the Hunter Database run by MCL Software Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to help the insurer check the information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When application for insurance is submitted the insurer dealing with your request for insurance may search these Registers and any other relevant registers. Under the terms and conditions of your policy, you must tell the insurer about any incident (such as an accident or theft) regardless of blame and whether a claim has been made or not. When you tell the insurer about an incident, the insurer will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant agents/bodies.

Insurers or brokers may also check with DVLA for the history of any motor convictions, fixed penalties or disqualifications recorded within the DVLA database.

This proof should be either a renewal notice or letter from your previous insurance provider, which shows the main driver as the policy holder (yourself) and the NCB declaration. A policy schedule is not the correct form of proof and may be rejected. The NCB can only be used on one policy at a time, and must have been used on a policy within the last 24 months.

You can also check information about your own vehicle at www.askmid.com. MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver’s use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad), other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers’ Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant car insurance policy information. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    All providers specialise in slightly different risks and they do not quote on risks that fall outside their target customers. The more “high risk” or “non-standard” your risk is classed as by them, the fewer prices you will receive. In some cases, it might not be possible for you obtain a quote at all over the Internet. In such cases we may put you in contact with a specialist telephone provider who will approach the insurance underwriters direct and negotiate a special rate on your behalf.

Full details of any fees for amendments related to your policy that you directly pay to your insurer can be found in your policy documentation. Any other fees will be discussed or advised of before proceeding with the policy. We provide Quotes for free of charge but if you decide to buy any policy by using Quotes or its reference, it may incur a separate administration fee. When you pay us any administration fee you only pay us for providing you with the Quotes (only when you choose to buy the policy, if you do not buy any policy, it is free) but not for setting up the policy. The quotes you are given always included our administration (Service) fee in it. If you give us any false or inaccurate information, it may result in cancellation of your policy and our administration fee will not be refunded.</strong></li>

                <strong>Events of accidents and Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE)</strong>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    Any driver who has had any accidents (fault or non-fault) or claims (whether claim made or not) in the last 5 years must disclose this information when asked, failing to do so may lead to an increase of the premium or it may invalidate insurance with the possibility of cancellation fees. Insurers or brokers may also check with CUE for the history of any accidents or claims recorded within the CUE database. The Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) is a central database of motor, home and personal injury/industrial illness incidents reported to insurance companies, which may or may not give rise to a claim.

                <p class="textp-justify">
                    Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited (IDS Ltd), the Hunter Database run by MCL Software Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register run by the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to help the insurer check the information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When application for insurance is submitted the insurer dealing with your request for insurance may search these Registers and any other relevant registers. Under the terms and conditions of your policy, you must tell the insurer about any incident (such as an accident or theft) regardless of blame and whether a claim has been made or not. When you tell the insurer about an incident, the insurer will pass this information to the Registers and to any other relevant agents/bodies.

                    Any driver who has had any motor convictions, fixed penalties or disqualifications in the last 5 years must disclose this information when asked, failing to do so may lead to an increase of the premium or it may invalidate insurance with the possibility of cancellation fees. Insurers or brokers may also check with DVLA for the history of any motor convictions, fixed penalties or disqualifications recorded within the DVLA database. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is the organisation of the UK Government responsible for maintaining a database of drivers and a database of vehicles in Great Britain.

                    Proof of No Claims Bonus (NCB) may be required if you take out a policy were a NCB has been applied. It is solely your responsibility to provide the proof of NCB. This proof should be either a renewal notice or letter from your previous insurance provider, which shows the main driver as the policy holder (yourself) and the NCB declaration. A policy schedule is not the correct form of proof and may be rejected. The NCB can only be used on one policy at a time, and must have been used on a policy within the last 24 months.

                    Your motor insurance policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers’ Information Centre (MIIC), sometimes it may take up to 7 days to get your policy details updated on the MID. You can also check information about your own vehicle at www.askmid.com. MID data may be used by the DVLA and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver’s use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad), other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers’ Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant car insurance policy information. Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this from the insurer, or at www.miic.org.uk

                <strong>Terms of risk and circumstances where the insurer is unable to provide a quote</strong>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    All providers specialise in slightly different risks and they do not quote on risks that fall outside their target customers. The more “high risk” or “non-standard” your risk is classed as by them, the fewer prices you will receive. In some cases, it might not be possible for you obtain a quote at all over the Internet. In such cases we may put you in contact with a specialist telephone provider who will approach the insurance underwriters direct and negotiate a special rate on your behalf.

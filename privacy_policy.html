                <p class="text-justify">
                    What is Spam? Spam is unsolicited e-mail, often of a commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or news groups. In short, spam is “junk e-mail.” As defined by H.R. 3113 and reported by the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, unsolicited e-mail refers to any electronic message that: advertises a product or service for profit is sent for other commercial purposes is sent to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing business relationship or invites the recipient to view content on an internet website that is operated for a commercial purpose. We recognises an e-mail as “spam” if: the recipient is unable to easily unsubscribe from the e-mail list the transmission contains invalid or forged headers invalid or non-existent domain name or other means of deceptive addressing, or in the opinion of the recipient the transmission and reception of the message appears to give a disproportionate benefit to the sender.
